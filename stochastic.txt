1. Probability space
(1)omiga contains all outcomes 
w=w1, w2, w3,...   w=H T
(2) sigma-algebra
F is collection of subsets oin omiga
   a. empty in F
   b. A in F, A complment also will in F
   c. if A1, A2, ... Ai,... in F, their infinite union of Ai in F

(3) Probability measure P  F->[0,1]
    a. P(omiga) = 1
    b. P(infinite union of Ai) = sum of P(Ai) when Ai in F and they are disjoint
  (omiga, F, P) <- prob space

Q1.1
i) A,B in F, A is subset of B then P(A) < P(B)
ii) A in F   An n from 1 to infinite in F, lim P(An) = 0 and A is subset of An =>P(A) = 0
solutions:
i) B = A U (B/A)
ii) A is subset of An for any n, so P(A) <= lim P(An) 

Q1.2 omiga infinite is uncountably infinite
countable set: a set with the same cardinality as the set of natural #
uncountable setï¼š infinite set whose cardinal number > that of the set of the natural #
A={w = w1w2w3..., w1=w2, w3=w4,...}
  i) A is uncountably infinite
  ii) when 0<p<1  P(A) = 0
solution:
i)
w = w1w2w3...
w' =w1w1w2w2w3w3...
so A<->omiga infinite, therefore A is uncountably infinite
ii)
first twice coin toss is HH or TT,  A is subset
P(A) <= p^2+(1-p)^2
first fourth coin tois is HHHH, HHTT, TTHH, TTTT
P(A) <= [p^2+(1-p)^2]^n for any n
because p^2+(1-p)^2 <1 when 0<p<1

Q1.3 for any subset A of [0,1], def: P(A) = 0 if A is a finite set, P(A) = infinite if A is an infinite set
i) P(empty) = 0
ii) P(AUB) = P(A)+P(B)   A intersect B equals empty
iii) P(U Ai) = sum of P(Ai)  i from 1 to N
iv) same as iii), but i from 1 to infinite, prove the equaltion don't exsit
solution:
  i) empty is not infinite
  ii) discussion: A and B is finite, at least A and B is a infinite set
  iv) although Ai are all finite set, union of them are infinite
  
Q1.4
i) construct a standard normal r,v, Z on the (omiga infinite, F infinite, P) for P=1/2
ii)
solution:
  i) omiga infinite = {w:w=w1w2w3...}  Yn(w) = 1 if wn=H, Yn(w) = 0 if wn = T
      Yn: omiga -> {0,1}
